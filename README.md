## Installation

- Enter app folder via console

  `$ cd notable-exercise`
  
- Install dependencies

  `$ yarn install`  

Thank you for the opportunity! Please see my notes below.  I did not have enough time to confirm operation of all features, but I do feel all the code is complete to satisfy the requirements.

## Requirements

- Get a list of all doctors 
- Get a list of all appointments for a particular doctor and particular day 
- Delete an existing appointment from a doctor's calendar 
- Add a new appointment to a doctor's calendar 
    New appointments can only start at 15 minute intervals (ie, 8:15AM is a valid time but 8:20AM is not) 
    A doctor can have multiple appointments with the same time, but no more than 3 appointments can be added with the same time for a given doctor


## Implementation
- In memory store of data

## TODO / nice to have
- Tests!
- Fix bugs!
- Confirm operation (did not have time to confirm all functionality)
- More organization around API endpoints 
- Add validation for params and body
- More error checking
- Use database!
- Check for duplicate names of doctors, patients
